# Be Anything Terms of Service
Last Updated *March 11, 2021*

This Terms of Service governs your use of our websites at beanything.co, and the Be Anything Application (collectively “the Be Anything Service”, “the Service” or “Be Anything”). By creating an account on Be Anything, you agree to be bound by our Terms of Service (our “Terms”). If you don’t agree, please don’t use Be Anything.  These Terms include a Binding Arbitration clause. Please read below to see how you can opt-out if you so choose.

## Privacy Promise
Protecting your privacy is important to us. The following describes our promises to you.
- We never sell your data or student data.
- We never advertise in Be Anything.
- We don’t own the content you add to Be Anything.
- Student work is private to students and their teachers.
- We use the latest security industry best practices to protect you.

## Be Anything and Parental Consent
We require that teachers or schools get parental consent before using Be Anything with children who are under the age when they can grant consent on their own.  This age may vary based on where you live. For example, in the US that age is younger than 13. You should check your local laws to determine the relevant age in your country.  If you are aware Be Anything is collecting information from a student without parental consent, please contact us immediately at admin@beanything.co and we will delete the data.
There are a number of ways in which teachers or schools can obtain parental consent:
- Get consent as part of a school-wide technology consent process you may already have in place.
- Use a consent form.
- For teachers in the United States, agree to act as the parent’s agent, and provide consent on their behalf to use Be Anything solely in the educational context as provided by the FTC.

## Be Anything and FERPA
Data collected by Be Anything may include personally identifiable information from education records that are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, “FERPA”, ("FERPA Records").  To the extent that Student Data includes FERPA Records, you designate Be Anything as a "School Official" (as that term is used in FERPA and its implementing regulations) under the direct control of the school with regard to the use and maintenance of the FERPA Records and Be Anything agrees to comply with FERPA.

## Creating a Teacher Account
Only teachers, school administrators, or district administrators can create a group on Be Anything.  Once the group is created, teachers can authorize student participants and additional faculty with appropriate permissions to create, view, comment on, and share work.
You should consult with your school or school district to ensure that you obtain proper consent to use Be Anything in the classroom consistent with their policies.
When you create a Be Anything group, you agree that:
- Any students you add to your group are current students in your class.
- Any additional teachers you add to your groups are authorized by your school to access student work.
- You will use Be Anything only for lawful purposes and abide by applicable law and school and school district policies in your use of Be Anything.
- You will treat Be Anything as an extension of the classroom and take reasonable steps to confirm that students are using Be Anything appropriately.
- You will take reasonable measures to protect access to information contained in student work and your assessments.
- You will protect your group codes and invite links so that access to student work is limited only to students and teachers, and other trusted adults.

## Creating a Student Account
Students may use Be Anything only if their parent or legal guardian has given permission to their teacher or school or are under the age when they can grant consent on their own.  This age may vary based on where they live. For example, in the US that age is younger than 13. You should check your local laws to determine the relevant age in your country. If you are aware Be Anything is collecting information from a student without proper consent, please contact us immediately at admin@beanything.co and we will delete the data.
Be Anything is an extension of the classroom. You agree to use Be Anything in a manner that is appropriate to the classroom. You may not violate the policies of your school or school district in your use of Be Anything. 

## Submissions to the PBL Universe
Project Handouts and skills teachers create are private to their account by default.  Optionally, teachers may choose to publish Project Handouts and Skills they create to the public PBL Universe or a PBL Universe managed by their school or district.  By choosing to submit your Project Handout or Skill to the PBL Universe, you’re telling us that:
- You are the copyright holder, you have the consent of the copyright holder, or you have a valid legal basis (for example, fair use) for posting any content you submit to Be Anything.
- You have secured permission to share the photograph of any person included in your Project Handout.
Any content you submit is yours - not Be Anything’s.  By submitting your Project Handout or Skill to the PBL Universe you understand that:
- Your Project Handout or Skills will be publicly accessible unless you choose to remove it.  Your name and other activities you have contributed to the PBL Universe will be visible as part of your Publisher Profile.
- For as long as your Project Handout or Skills is published to the PBL Universe, your Project Handout or Skills may be shared by Be Anything (for example on our website or in an email) and by teachers using Be Anything.  Teachers using Be Anything may also modify your Project Handout or Skills and re-share them with their students or other teachers.
- If you remove your Project Handout or Skills from the PBL Universe, prior copies of your Project Handout and Skills or modified versions of your Project Handout and Skills may still exist in other teachers’ accounts and will not be removed.
- Student work that is linked to Project Handouts and Skills is not shared in the PBL Universe.

## Your Intellectual Property
We don’t own the content you provide – students and their schools own all Student Data added to Be Anything.
However, in order to provide our Services, we need certain limited rights to your content. For example, when you add your content, we need the rights to store it and serve it back to you.  Therefore, you grant Be Anything the right to use, publish, transmit, display, copy, process, adapt, modify, and distribute your content only how you specify and only within the context of the Be Anything service.

## Account Transfer
If you’ve signed up with a school or district provided email address, and your school or district later signs up for a Be Anything school or district account, we may transfer your account to be under the management and control of your school or district.  To protect student data, in certain limited circumstances (such as when a teacher leaves a school or district) we may transfer a group to a different teacher if we receive a properly authorized request from the relevant school or district.
